# README

This is a template repository for running [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) on Render. 

* It uses the [official](https://hub.docker.com/r/mysql/mysql-server) MySQL Docker image.

* [Render Disks](https://render.com/docs/disks) provide fast, persistent SSD storage for your database.

* MySQL runs in your [private network](https://render.com/docs/private-services) and isn't exposed to the public Internet.

## Deployment

See https://render.com/docs/deploy-mysql.
